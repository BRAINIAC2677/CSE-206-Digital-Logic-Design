# CSE-206 | Digital Logic Design

This repo contains my logisim designs of the sessional course CSE-206 of BUET.

## Resources:

-   [Truth Table Generator](https://www.dcode.fr/boolean-truth-table)
-   [Labsheet](https://github.com/BRAINIAC2677/Digital-Logic-Design/tree/main/assets)
-   [7400 logisim library](https://github.com/BRAINIAC2677/Digital-Logic-Design/tree/main/assets/logisim)
-   [Logisim for windows](https://github.com/BRAINIAC2677/Digital-Logic-Design/tree/main/assets/logisim)

## How To Use:

-   Download logisim exe file from logisim website.
-   In almost all the .circ files of this repo logisim library '7400-lib.circ' has been used.
-   While opening any .circ in which the above library is included, you will be prompted to give the location of the above library. After doing that .circ should open in logisim correctly.
