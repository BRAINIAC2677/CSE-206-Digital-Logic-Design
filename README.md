## How To Run:

-   Download logisim exe file from [here](/assets/logisim/logisim-win-2.7.1.exe) or from logisim website.
-   In almost all the .circ files of this repo logisim library [`7400-lib.circ`](/assets/logisim/7400-lib.circ) has been used. 
-   While opening any .circ in which the above library is included, you will be prompted to give the location of the above library. After doing that .circ should open in logisim correctly.
